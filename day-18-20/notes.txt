Day 18
Flexbox Challenge #4 solution - Writing mobile-first CSS

Should start with reset and typography first!

On type it's useful to remove the margins. Especially margin-top:
h1, h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
    OR
    margin: 0;
}

Prefer mobile 1st because without worrying about layouts. We can just focus on the basics: typography, spacing, color scheme, etc.
