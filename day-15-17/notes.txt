Lesson 01: Media query basics
Why we need media queries?
Let us add or override existing styles that only target specific conditions

Code not in media queries is default, in queries = add/override

A media queries can specify media features & type(print, display, etc.)

min-width = Mobile 1st = at least 600px or bigger
max-width = Desktop 1st = at most 600px or smaller
can be combined with and = between

Media queries order IS important!

If using mobile 1st/min-width
uses ascending order, smaller 1st

If using desktop 1st/max-width
uses descending order


Day 16
Lesson 01: How do decide what breakpoints to use?
When does my layout start to fail/becomes broken?
Do have different breakpoints between each section!
Breakpoints should be for the entire page!

Don't kill yourself with having 10 different breakpoints
Don't overthink it!
Should only have a handful, ~2-4?

Try to use the minimal amount of breakpoints you need to have a nice looking and functional layout

IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT FOR EVERY DEVICE/SCREEN SIZE!

AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PIXEL PERFECT!

Also don't target specific devices

Just get a general idea of when site is breaking and add breakpoints there!

The tl;dr of the article: Use 600px, 900px, 1200px, and 1800px if you plan on giving the giant-monitor people something special.

1. Get your breakpoints right
2. Name your ranges sensibly
3. Be declarative

@mixin for-phone-only {
  @media (max-width: 599px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-tablet-portrait-up {
  @media (min-width: 600px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-tablet-landscape-up {
  @media (min-width: 900px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-desktop-up {
  @media (min-width: 1200px) { @content; }
}
@mixin for-big-desktop-up {
  @media (min-width: 1800px) { @content; }
}

// usage
.my-box {
  padding: 10px;

  @include for-desktop-up {
    padding: 20px;
  }
}

5 Breakpoints for types of devices: Phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, Large desktop


Will start to get a feel of when things usually break, like at 600px, 900px, etc.
